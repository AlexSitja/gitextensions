    <h1>Quick Guide to GitHub</h1>
    <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that utilizes Git, a version control system, to manage and collaborate on projects. Here's a concise overview of how GitHub works:</p>

    <h2>Repositories:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Repositories (repos) are where your project's files and revision history are stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Function:</strong> Users can create, clone, or fork repositories to work on projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Version Control with Git:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Snapshot-Based System:</strong> Git captures snapshots (commits) of project changes, allowing users to track modifications over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Branching:</strong> Users can create branches to experiment with new features or fixes without affecting the main project until changes are ready.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Collaboration:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> Contributors propose changes to a repository by creating pull requests. These changes can be reviewed, discussed, and merged into the main project.</li>
        <li><strong>Issues:</strong> Users can report bugs, suggest enhancements, or discuss ideas through issues. They're used to track and manage tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>GitHub Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Forks:</strong> Users can create a copy (fork) of a repository to propose changes or work independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Wiki and Pages:</strong> GitHub allows for documentation creation through Wikis and hosting simple websites through GitHub Pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Actions:</strong> Automate workflows with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Access Control and Collaboration:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> Repository owners can manage access by granting different permissions to collaborators (read, write, admin).</li>
        <li><strong>Teams:</strong> Users can be organized into teams for better collaboration and access control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Community Engagement:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Social Features:</strong> Users can follow projects, star repositories, and contribute to open-source projects, fostering community interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Contributing Guidelines:</strong> Repositories often include guidelines for contributing to maintain consistency in the contributions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>GitHub Desktop and CLI:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> GitHub offers desktop applications and a command-line interface (CLI) for easier interaction with repositories.</li>
    </ul>
